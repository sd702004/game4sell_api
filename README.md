# Game4Sell API

[Game4Sell](https://www.game4sell.ir) website was developed several years ago
using pure PHP and tools such as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery.

Recently, it was decided to modernize the website by converting it into a
single-page application to improve user experience. As a result, a complete
rewrite of the project was initiated in both the frontend and backend, and the
site's redevelopment is currently in progress using Python and Node.js. The
frontend is being built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), and the backend API is being developed with [Django
REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

This repository contains a subset of the API code. Due to confidentiality
constraints, the complete codebase cannot be disclosed. The provided code is
offered as a representative of my work.
